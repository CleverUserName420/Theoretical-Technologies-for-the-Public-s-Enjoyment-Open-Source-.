This will be updated from time to time. Take the information then upload your discoveries. Everyone has a unique perspective that is valued especially if it is logical, reasonable, sensible, rational,ethical, and doesn't employ psychological warfare like tricks etc. 

Open source theoretical research. (All are drafts)
- Quantum teleportation
- Smartdust detection software leveraging built in hardware of conventional devices such as Macbook.
- Some malware detection software stuff for cyber security.
- Counter crime and corruption red teaming.
- Signals
- (Coming soon - Phrases and methods of manipulation/abuse/harassment/Psywarfare used in crime/corruption in order to identify them and to counter)



  RULES:
  - Poisening the well is illegal (If using this content)
  - No one financially profits from this. Any profits go towards the reduction of crime/corruption & uneccessary pain and suffering of human-beings.
  - Do not look into the darpa stuff pertaining to the (redacted) part of the "from here to there" I've already done all of that and have created IP with that and there is a reason why it is redacted. So please do not look into that. It was made for mitigation purposes.


Concepts to note:
- If so and but.
- cause and effect.
- Losing your pencil = death (Logic exercise)
- "Theoretically speaking, if (Blank) did exist or was operational despite research and testing coming to an end on (Blank) date and there being a patnet, how could/would it be detected?"
- I have an NDA which permits me to do this without needing to explain my research methods. 
- Could pen testing the fabric of space/time be around the corner? https://claude.ai/share/76bd872c-234a-4a0c-bd0b-0b830a5d53af This is a public repo so the race is on. 
- The "Here to there" stuff is pretty cool because no matter who you are, you could be the poorest or the wealthiest human-being alive and you feel utterly powerless. ^
