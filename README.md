  RULES:
  - Poisening the well is illegal (If using this content)
  - No one financially profits from this. Any profits go towards the reduction of crime/corruption & uneccessary pain and suffering of human-beings.
  - Do not look into the darpa stuff pertaining to the (redacted) part of the "from here to there" I've already done all of that and have created IP with that and there is a reason why it is redacted. So please do not look into that. It was made for mitigation purposes.


Concepts to note:
- If so and but.
- cause and effect.
- Losing your pencil = death (Logic exercise)
- "Theoretically speaking, if (Blank) did exist or was operational despite research and testing coming to an end on (Blank) date and there being a patnet, how could/would it be detected?"
