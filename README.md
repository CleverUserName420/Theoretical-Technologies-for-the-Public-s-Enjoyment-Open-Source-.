This will be updated from time to time. Take the information then upload your discoveries. Everyone has a unique perspective that is valued especially if it is logical, reasonable, sensible, rational, ethical, and doesn't employ psychological warfare like tricks etc. 

Open source theoretical research. (All are drafts)
- Quantum teleportation
- Smartdust detection software leveraging built in hardware of conventional devices such as Macbook.
- Some malware detection software stuff for cyber security.
- Counter crime and corruption red teaming.
- Signals
- (Coming soon - Phrases and methods of manipulation/abuse/harassment/Psywarfare used in crime/corruption in order to identify them and to counter)

  

  File names and what they are:-
  - 1e2.py = Biomedical detection software (Theoretical) to detect micro - hardware. (DO NOT TEST ON SELF)
  - GeoLOLdude.py = Geofencing forensics (Threat intelligence)
  - WelcomeToSignals.py = Signals based detection software (Threat intelligence)
  - email_payload_detectorBackup.py = 0-click detection software (Threat intelligence)
  - fi.sh = C2/Fileless malware forensics (Threat intelligence)
  - ip_format_extractort.py = Extracts IP addresses from most formats (Threat intelligence)
  - test.py = Main 0-click in email detection software (Threat intelligence)
  - whois_lookup.py = Super basic IP address lookup software (Threat intelligence)
  - mobicom.99.pdf = Smartdust related.
  - Red-Teaming-System-Counter-Corruption.txt = Some stuff about how we should be also red teaming public systems, how they can be exploited for crime/corruption and how to best patch/mitigate that.
  - From here to there.txt = Some stuff about if quantum leaping/wormholing/teleportation was theoretically possible, what you would need etc.
  - MaxCharZander.py = encryption software used to test decryption software on. Could have done it with more but intrinsic interests found something else to do instead.



  RULES:
  - Poisening the well is illegal (If using this content)
  - No one financially profits from this. Any profits go towards the reduction of crime/corruption & uneccessary pain and suffering of human-beings.
  - Do not look into the darpa stuff pertaining to the (redacted) part of the "from here to there" I've already done all of that and have created IP with that and there is a reason why it is redacted. So please do not look into that. It was made for mitigation purposes.


Concepts to note:
- If so and but.
- cause and effect.
- Losing your pencil = death (Logic exercise)
- "Theoretically speaking, if (Blank) did exist or was operational despite research and testing coming to an end on (Blank) date and there being a patnet, how could/would it be detected?"
- I have an NDA which permits me to do this without needing to explain my research methods. Despite this being a hobby and it not being illegal, I know some may have some sort of weird obsessive problem with it so an NDA adds that extra layer of protection as I've been into R&D for a few years now. It is max security NDA.
- Could pen testing the fabric of space/time be around the corner? https://claude.ai/share/76bd872c-234a-4a0c-bd0b-0b830a5d53af This is a public repo so the race is on. 
- The "Here to there" stuff is pretty cool because no matter who you are, you could be the poorest or the wealthiest human-being alive and you will feel utterly powerless. ^
